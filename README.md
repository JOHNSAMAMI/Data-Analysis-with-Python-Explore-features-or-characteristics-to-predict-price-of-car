# Data-Analysis-with-Python-Explore-features-or-characteristics-to-predict-price-of-car
In this comprehensive data analysis and modeling project, I focused on predicting car prices using Python. The project journey began with a thorough Data Wrangling phase, encompassing the identification and handling of missing values, data standardization, normalization, binning, and the creation of indicator variables. Moving into the Data Analysis with Python phase, I conducted a detailed exploration of individual feature patterns through visualization, descriptive statistical analysis, basics of grouping, and examinations of correlation and causation, including ANOVA. Finally, in the Model Development section, I built prediction models and rigorously evaluated their performance, providing a robust framework for predicting car prices based on various features and characteristics.
